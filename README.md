### Water level indicator uses transistors which accepts the input signals in order to allow current to on and hence the circuit indicates the water level.
### Fire Alarm uses the thermistor to detect heat which than allows current to pass through it and hence the circuit indicates about alarming situation.
### Rain alarm uses the sensor whose two connections are to be connected by means of water which is fullled by rain droplets which than turns on the alarm to indicate about rain.
### Intruder detector detects the objects passing between the LDR face and LED which than turns on the alarming buzzer to indicate about any intruder.
### 9V battery is used in this project whose current value ranges within 400-600 mAh capacity.
