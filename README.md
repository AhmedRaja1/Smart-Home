# Smart-Home
All in one home reliability, ease and security. 5+ circuits amalgamation into a smart home

Water level indicator uses transistors which accepts the input signals
in order to allow current to 
ow and hence the circuit indicates the
water level.
 Fire Alarm uses the thermistor to detect heat which than allows
current to pass through it and hence the circuit indicates about
alarming situation.
 Rain alarm uses the sensor whose two connections are to be
connected by means of water which is fullled by rain droplets which
than turns on the alarm to indicate about rain.
 Intruder detector detects the objects passing between the LDR face
and LED which than turns on the alarming buzzer to indicate about
any intruder.
 9V battery is used in this project whose current value ranges within
400-600 mAh capacity.
